# Welcome to the Vexgate API!
This is a wrapper API for the Destiny 2 API, built using their [OpenAPI 3.0](https://github.com/Bungie-net/api/blob/master/openapi.json) spec.
This project is designed to be a wrapper around the Destiny 2 API, to make it easier for anyone wishing to implement the API, in the hopes of making it more accessible to everyone.
### To that end, I started this project with the following goals:
* Handle details like HTTPS, data request/manipulation, account switching, etc. automatically
* Adaptability/Flexibility, with as little development as possible

If you've made it this far, and want to try this for yourself, head over to [Getting Started (under construction)]()
